## Preamble

I'm currently working as an MLOps Engineer at [Climate Policy Radar](https://www.climatepolicyradar.org). Outside of work, I'm blogging about projects, research, and other things, across topics mostly about software engineering and machine learning. When I can, I contribute to open-source projects. You can look at my [dotfiles](https://github.com/jesse-c/dotfiles/) too!

Here's a sample:
